# Emergent Intelligence Substrates

Hallo Researcher!

Welcome to the Github of Emerging Intelligence Substrates group!

At the EIS lab, we are driven by the question of how intelligence emerges from a physical substrate. 

Brain’s functionality has long been postulated to be related to its structure. This structure-function relationship is present at all levels of the hierarchy, from neurons and synapses, to dendritic arbors and of course, to neuronal connectivity. The low-level structures perform spatio-temporal filtering, while the higher-level structures define the dynamic interaction among the low-level features giving rise to functional graphs through connectivity.  
In other words, in the brain, the hardware substrate is the algorithm, without an operating system. 
The structure of this substrate changes and self-organizes itself to the information it receives throughout its lifespan, to learn at different spatial and temporal time scales, which is the hallmark of brain’s intelligence. 

Inspired by the structure-functionality duality in the brain, at the EIS lab, we exploit the physics of electronic substrates, silicon and resistive memory technologies, at different spatial and temporal scales, to build intelligent systems.
